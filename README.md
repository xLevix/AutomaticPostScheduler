I am currently working on an engineering thesis:

Web application to automatic generation and scheduling of posts published in social media based on artificial intelligence-assisted tools like ChatGPT.

The project is written in Next.js, serverless. I use QStash service cron as background tasks and AWS S3 for file processing. OAuth2 method is used as the primary authorization option.
